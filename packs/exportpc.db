On the one hand, a singular feature of the class is that no two fighters ply their craft in quite the same way; their weapons, armor, and tactics differ across a vast spectrum. On the other hand, regardless of the tools and methods one uses, at the heart of every fighter's motivation lies the same basic truth: it is better to wound than to be wounded.</p><p>Although some adventuring fighters risk their lives fighting for glory or treasure, others are primarily concerned with the welfare of others. They put more value on the well-being of the society, the village, or the group than on their own safety. Even if there's gold in the offing, the true reward for most fighters comes from sending enemies to their doom.</p><p>The sections below offer ways to add a little depth and a few personal touches to your fighter character.</p><h1>Heraldic Sign</h1><p>Fighters typically do battle for a cause. Some fight on behalf of kingdoms besieged by monsters, while others quest only for personal glory. In either case, a fighter often displays a heraldic sign that represents that cause, either adopting the symbol of a nation or a royal line, or creating a crest to represent one's self-interest.</p><p>Your character could be affiliated with an organization or a cause, and thus might already travel under a banner of some sort. If that's not the case, consider devising a heraldic sign that symbolizes an aspect of your nature or speaks to what you see as your purpose in the world.</p><p>@RollTable[HJ776t8fu4sGBJVj]<b>Table:</b> Heraldic Signs</p><h1>Instructor</h1><p>Some fighters are natural-born combatants who have a talent for surviving in battle. Others learned the basics of their combat prowess in their formative years from spending time in a military or some other martial organization, when they were taught by the leaders of the group.</p><p>A third type of fighter comes from the ranks of those who received one-on-one instruction from an accomplished veteran of the craft. That instructor was, or perhaps still is, well versed in a certain aspect of combat that relates to the student's background.</p><p>If you decide that your character had an individual instructor, what is that person's specialty? Do you emulate your instructor in how you fight, or did you take the instructor's teachings and adapt them to your own purposes?</p><p>@RollTable[ict60M9eOr18M6nX]<b>Table:</b> Instructors</p><h1>Signature Style</h1><p>Many fighters distinguish themselves from their peers by adopting and perfecting a particular style or method of waging combat. Although this style might be a natural outgrowth of a fighter's personality, that's not always the case-someone's approach to the world in general does not necessarily dictate how that person operates when lives are on the line.</p><p>Do you have a combat style that mirrors your outlook on life, or is something else inside you unleashed when weapons are drawn?</p><p>@RollTable[rcGvHafGXVepNzMR]<b>Table:</b> Signature Styles</p><h1>The Fighter</h1><table><tr decoration=\"underline\"><td><b>Level</b></td><td><b>Proficiency Bonus</b></td><td

On the one hand, a singular feature of the class is that no two fighters ply their craft in quite the same way; their weapons, armor, and tactics differ across a vast spectrum. On the other hand, regardless of the tools and methods one uses, at the heart of every fighter's motivation lies the same basic truth: it is better to wound than to be wounded.</p><p>Although some adventuring fighters risk their lives fighting for glory or treasure, others are primarily concerned with the welfare of others. They put more value on the well-being of the society, the village, or the group than on their own safety. Even if there's gold in the offing, the true reward for most fighters comes from sending enemies to their doom.</p><p>The sections below offer ways to add a little depth and a few personal touches to your fighter character.</p><h1>Heraldic Sign</h1><p>Fighters typically do battle for a cause. Some fight on behalf of kingdoms besieged by monsters, while others quest only for personal glory. In either case, a fighter often displays a heraldic sign that represents that cause, either adopting the symbol of a nation or a royal line, or creating a crest to represent one's self-interest.</p><p>Your character could be affiliated with an organization or a cause, and thus might already travel under a banner of some sort. If that's not the case, consider devising a heraldic sign that symbolizes an aspect of your nature or speaks to what you see as your purpose in the world.</p><p>@RollTable[HJ776t8fu4sGBJVj]<b>Table:</b> Heraldic Signs</p><h1>Instructor</h1><p>Some fighters are natural-born combatants who have a talent for surviving in battle. Others learned the basics of their combat prowess in their formative years from spending time in a military or some other martial organization, when they were taught by the leaders of the group.</p><p>A third type of fighter comes from the ranks of those who received one-on-one instruction from an accomplished veteran of the craft. That instructor was, or perhaps still is, well versed in a certain aspect of combat that relates to the student's background.</p><p>If you decide that your character had an individual instructor, what is that person's specialty? Do you emulate your instructor in how you fight, or did you take the instructor's teachings and adapt them to your own purposes?</p><p>@RollTable[ict60M9eOr18M6nX]<b>Table:</b> Instructors</p><h1>Signature Style</h1><p>Many fighters distinguish themselves from their peers by adopting and perfecting a particular style or method of waging combat. Although this style might be a natural outgrowth of a fighter's personality, that's not always the case-someone's approach to the world in general does not necessarily dictate how that person operates when lives are on the line.</p><p>Do you have a combat style that mirrors your outlook on life, or is something else inside you unleashed when weapons are drawn?</p><p>@RollTable[rcGvHafGXVepNzMR]<b>Table:</b> Signature Styles</p><h1>The Fighter</h1><table><tr decoration=\"underline\"><td><b>Level</b></td><td><b>Proficiency Bonus</b></td><td

Fighting is for fools. Dead men can't spend their fortunes.\n</i><b>-Barnabas Bladecutter</b></p><p>When brute force won't get the job done, or when magic isn't available or appropriate, the rogue rises to the fore. With skills tied to stealth, subterfuge, and trickery, rogues can get into and out of trouble in ways that few other characters can emulate.</p><p>Some rogues who turn to adventuring are former criminals who have decided that dodging monsters is preferable to remaining one step ahead of the law. Others are professional killers in search of a profitable application of their talents between contracts. Some simply love the thrill of overcoming any challenge that stands in their way.</p><p>On adventures, a rogue is likely to mix an outwardly cautious approach-few rogues enjoy combat-with a ravenous hunger for loot. Most of the time, in a rogue's mind, taking up arms against a creature is not about killing the creature but about becoming the new owner of its treasure.</p><p>The following sections explore certain facets of what it means to be a rogue, which you can use to add depth to your character.</p><h1>Guilty Pleasure</h1><p>Most of what rogues do revolves around obtaining treasure and preventing others from doing the same. Little gets in the way of attaining those goals, except that many rogues are enticed away from that path by a compulsion that clouds their thinking-an irresistible need that must be satisfied, even if doing so is risky.</p><p>A rogue's guilty pleasure could be the acquisition of a physical item, something to be experienced, or a way of conducting oneself at certain times. One rogue might not be able to pass up any loot made of silver, for instance, even if said loot is hanging around the neck of a castle guard. Another one can't go through a day in the city without lifting a purse or two, just to keep in practice.</p><p>What's the one form of temptation that your rogue character can't resist when the opportunity presents itself, even if giving into it might mean trouble for you and your companions?</p><p>@RollTable[nMHkhVeqs1QjSWHF]<b>Table:</b> Guilty Pleasures</p><h1>Adversary</h1><p>Naturally, those who enforce the law are bound to come up against those who break it, and it's the rare rogue who isn't featured on at least one wanted poster. Beyond that, it's in the nature of their profession that rogues often come into contact with criminal elements, whether out of choice or necessity. Some of those people can be adversaries too, and they're likely to be harder to deal with than the average member of the city watch.</p><p>If your character's backstory doesn't already include a personage of this sort, you could work with your DM to come up with a reason why an adversary has appeared in your life. Perhaps you've been the subject of scrutiny for a while from someone who wants to use you for nefarious purposes and has just now become known to you. Such an incident could be the basis for an upcoming adventure.</p><p>Does your rogue character have an adversary who also happens to be a criminal? If so, how is this relationship affecting your life?</p><p>@RollTable[AIjFeylMcaHVW1Aw]<b>Table:</b> Adversaries</p><h1>Benefactor</h1><p>Few rogues make it far in life before needing someone's help, which means thereafter owing that benefactor a significant debt.</p><p>If your character's backstory doesn't already include a personage of this sort, you could work with your DM to determine why a benefactor has appeared in your life. Perhaps you benefited from something your benefactor did for you without realizing who was responsible, and that person has now just become known to you. Who helped you in the past, whether or not you knew it at the time, and what do you owe that person as recompense?</p><p>@RollTable[MHXXeVtkmIFUvO8n]<b>Table:</b> Benefactors</p><h1>The

type=\"formattedtext\"><h1>Cleric</h1><p><i>To become a cleric is to become a messenger of the gods. The power the divine offers is great, but it always comes with tremendous responsibility.\n</i><b>-Riggby the patriarch</b></p><p>Almost all the folk in the world who revere a deity live their lives without ever being directly touched by a divine being. As such, they can never know what it feels like to be a cleric-someone who is not only a devout worshiper, but who has also been invested with a measure of a deity's power.</p><p>The question has long been debated: Does a mortal become a cleric as a consequence of deep devotion to one's deity, thereby attracting the god's favor? Or is it the deity who sees the potential in a person and calls that individual into service? Ultimately, perhaps, the answer doesn't matter. However clerics come into being, the world needs clerics as much as clerics and deities need each other.</p><p>If you're playing a cleric character, the following sections offer ways to add some detail to that character's history and personality.</p><h1>Temple</h1><p>Most clerics start their lives of service as priests in an order, then later realize that they have been blessed by their god with the qualities needed to become a cleric. To prepare for this new duty, candidates typically receive instruction from a cleric of a temple or another place of study devoted to their deity.</p><p>Some temples are cut off from the world so that their occupants can focus on devotions, while other temples open their doors to minister to and heal the masses. What is noteworthy about the temple you studied at?</p><p>@RollTable[nWvRvQeMKUoyZBar]<b>Table:</b> Temples</p><h1>Keepsake</h1><p>Many clerics have items among their personal gear that symbolize their faith, remind them of their vows, or otherwise help to keep them on their chosen paths. Even though such an item is not imbued with divine power, it is vitally important to its owner because of what it represents.</p><p>@RollTable[qNRWgGMWVhAdV0wv]<b>Table:</b> Keepsake</p><h1>Secret</h1><p>No mortal soul is entirely free of second thoughts or doubt. Even a cleric must grapple with dark desires or the forbidden attraction of turning against the teachings of one's deity.</p><p>If you haven't considered this aspect of your character yet, see the table entries for some possibilities, or use them for inspiration. Your deep, dark secret might involve something you did (or are doing), or it could be rooted in the way you feel about the world and your role in it.</p><p>@RollTable[UTiEfFyynFri4cqW]<b>Table:</b> Secrets</p><h1>Serving a Pantheon, Philosophy, or Force</h1><p>The typical cleric is an ordained servant of a particular god and chooses a Divine Domain associated with that deity. The cleric's magic flows from the god or the god's sacred realm, and often the cleric bears a holy symbol that represents that divinity.</p><p>Some clerics, especially in a world like Eberron, serve a whole pantheon, rather than a single deity. In certain campaigns, a cleric might instead serve a cosmic force, such as life or death, or a philosophy or concept, such as love, peace, or one of the nine alignments. Chapter 1 of the <i>Dungeon Master's Guide</i> explores options like these, in the section \"Gods of Your World.\"</p><p>Talk with your DM about the divine options available in your campaign, whether they're gods, pantheons, philosophies, or cosmic forces. Whatever being or thing your cleric ends up serving, choose a Divine Domain that is appropriate for it, and if it doesn't have a holy symbol, work with your DM to design one.</p><p>The cleric's class features often refer to your deity. If you are devoted to a pantheon, cosmic force, or philosophy, your cleric features still work for you as written. Think of the references to a god as references to the divine thing you serve that gives you your magic.</p><h1>The Cleric</h1><table><tr

Fighting is for fools. Dead men can't spend their fortunes.\n</i><b>-Barnabas Bladecutter</b></p><p>When brute force won't get the job done, or when magic isn't available or appropriate, the rogue rises to the fore. With skills tied to stealth, subterfuge, and trickery, rogues can get into and out of trouble in ways that few other characters can emulate.</p><p>Some rogues who turn to adventuring are former criminals who have decided that dodging monsters is preferable to remaining one step ahead of the law. Others are professional killers in search of a profitable application of their talents between contracts. Some simply love the thrill of overcoming any challenge that stands in their way.</p><p>On adventures, a rogue is likely to mix an outwardly cautious approach-few rogues enjoy combat-with a ravenous hunger for loot. Most of the time, in a rogue's mind, taking up arms against a creature is not about killing the creature but about becoming the new owner of its treasure.</p><p>The following sections explore certain facets of what it means to be a rogue, which you can use to add depth to your character.</p><h1>Guilty Pleasure</h1><p>Most of what rogues do revolves around obtaining treasure and preventing others from doing the same. Little gets in the way of attaining those goals, except that many rogues are enticed away from that path by a compulsion that clouds their thinking-an irresistible need that must be satisfied, even if doing so is risky.</p><p>A rogue's guilty pleasure could be the acquisition of a physical item, something to be experienced, or a way of conducting oneself at certain times. One rogue might not be able to pass up any loot made of silver, for instance, even if said loot is hanging around the neck of a castle guard. Another one can't go through a day in the city without lifting a purse or two, just to keep in practice.</p><p>What's the one form of temptation that your rogue character can't resist when the opportunity presents itself, even if giving into it might mean trouble for you and your companions?</p><p>@RollTable[nMHkhVeqs1QjSWHF]<b>Table:</b> Guilty Pleasures</p><h1>Adversary</h1><p>Naturally, those who enforce the law are bound to come up against those who break it, and it's the rare rogue who isn't featured on at least one wanted poster. Beyond that, it's in the nature of their profession that rogues often come into contact with criminal elements, whether out of choice or necessity. Some of those people can be adversaries too, and they're likely to be harder to deal with than the average member of the city watch.</p><p>If your character's backstory doesn't already include a personage of this sort, you could work with your DM to come up with a reason why an adversary has appeared in your life. Perhaps you've been the subject of scrutiny for a while from someone who wants to use you for nefarious purposes and has just now become known to you. Such an incident could be the basis for an upcoming adventure.</p><p>Does your rogue character have an adversary who also happens to be a criminal? If so, how is this relationship affecting your life?</p><p>@RollTable[AIjFeylMcaHVW1Aw]<b>Table:</b> Adversaries</p><h1>Benefactor</h1><p>Few rogues make it far in life before needing someone's help, which means thereafter owing that benefactor a significant debt.</p><p>If your character's backstory doesn't already include a personage of this sort, you could work with your DM to determine why a benefactor has appeared in your life. Perhaps you benefited from something your benefactor did for you without realizing who was responsible, and that person has now just become known to you. Who helped you in the past, whether or not you knew it at the time, and what do you owe that person as recompense?</p><p>@RollTable[MHXXeVtkmIFUvO8n]<b>Table:</b> Benefactors</p><h1>The

type=\"formattedtext\"><h1>Cleric</h1><p><i>To become a cleric is to become a messenger of the gods. The power the divine offers is great, but it always comes with tremendous responsibility.\n</i><b>-Riggby the patriarch</b></p><p>Almost all the folk in the world who revere a deity live their lives without ever being directly touched by a divine being. As such, they can never know what it feels like to be a cleric-someone who is not only a devout worshiper, but who has also been invested with a measure of a deity's power.</p><p>The question has long been debated: Does a mortal become a cleric as a consequence of deep devotion to one's deity, thereby attracting the god's favor? Or is it the deity who sees the potential in a person and calls that individual into service? Ultimately, perhaps, the answer doesn't matter. However clerics come into being, the world needs clerics as much as clerics and deities need each other.</p><p>If you're playing a cleric character, the following sections offer ways to add some detail to that character's history and personality.</p><h1>Temple</h1><p>Most clerics start their lives of service as priests in an order, then later realize that they have been blessed by their god with the qualities needed to become a cleric. To prepare for this new duty, candidates typically receive instruction from a cleric of a temple or another place of study devoted to their deity.</p><p>Some temples are cut off from the world so that their occupants can focus on devotions, while other temples open their doors to minister to and heal the masses. What is noteworthy about the temple you studied at?</p><p>@RollTable[nWvRvQeMKUoyZBar]<b>Table:</b> Temples</p><h1>Keepsake</h1><p>Many clerics have items among their personal gear that symbolize their faith, remind them of their vows, or otherwise help to keep them on their chosen paths. Even though such an item is not imbued with divine power, it is vitally important to its owner because of what it represents.</p><p>@RollTable[qNRWgGMWVhAdV0wv]<b>Table:</b> Keepsake</p><h1>Secret</h1><p>No mortal soul is entirely free of second thoughts or doubt. Even a cleric must grapple with dark desires or the forbidden attraction of turning against the teachings of one's deity.</p><p>If you haven't considered this aspect of your character yet, see the table entries for some possibilities, or use them for inspiration. Your deep, dark secret might involve something you did (or are doing), or it could be rooted in the way you feel about the world and your role in it.</p><p>@RollTable[UTiEfFyynFri4cqW]<b>Table:</b> Secrets</p><h1>Serving a Pantheon, Philosophy, or Force</h1><p>The typical cleric is an ordained servant of a particular god and chooses a Divine Domain associated with that deity. The cleric's magic flows from the god or the god's sacred realm, and often the cleric bears a holy symbol that represents that divinity.</p><p>Some clerics, especially in a world like Eberron, serve a whole pantheon, rather than a single deity. In certain campaigns, a cleric might instead serve a cosmic force, such as life or death, or a philosophy or concept, such as love, peace, or one of the nine alignments. Chapter 1 of the <i>Dungeon Master's Guide</i> explores options like these, in the section \"Gods of Your World.\"</p><p>Talk with your DM about the divine options available in your campaign, whether they're gods, pantheons, philosophies, or cosmic forces. Whatever being or thing your cleric ends up serving, choose a Divine Domain that is appropriate for it, and if it doesn't have a holy symbol, work with your DM to design one.</p><p>The cleric's class features often refer to your deity. If you are devoted to a pantheon, cosmic force, or philosophy, your cleric features still work for you as written. Think of the references to a god as references to the divine thing you serve that gives you your magic.</p><h1>The Cleric</h1><table><tr

But the question I ask you is, can a bard go to the root of this tree? Can one tap into the source of that power? Ah, then what manner of music they would bring to this world!\n</i><b>-Fletcher Danairia, master bard</b></p><p>@JournalEntry[XMSzlE73N0rwYp0N]<b>Image:</b> Bards</p><p>Bards bring levity during grave times; they impart wisdom to offset ignorance; and they make the ridiculous seem sublime. Bards are preservers of ancient history, their songs and tales perpetuating the memory of great events down through time-knowledge so important that it is memorized and passed along as oral history, to survive even when no written record remains.</p><p>It is also the bard's role to chronicle smaller and more contemporary events-the stories of today's heroes, including their feats of valor as well as their less than impressive failures.</p><p>Of course, the world has many people who can carry a tune or tell a good story, and there's much more to any adventuring bard than a glib tongue and a melodious voice. Yet what truly sets bards apart from others-and from one another-are the style and substance of their performances.</p><p>To grab and hold the attention of an audience, bards are typically flamboyant and outgoing when they perform. The most famous of them are essentially the D&amp;D world's equivalent of pop stars. If you're playing a bard, consider using one of your favorite musicians as a role model for your character.</p><p>You can add some unique aspects to your bard character by considering the suggestions that follow.</p><h1>Defining Work</h1><p>Every successful bard is renowned for at least one piece of performance art, typically a song or a poem that is popular with everyone who hears it. These performances are spoken about for years by those who view them, and some spectators have had their lives forever changed because of the experience.</p><p>If your character is just starting out, your ultimate defining work is likely in the future. But in order to make any sort of living at your profession, chances are you already have a piece or two in your repertoire that have proven to be audience pleasers.</p><p>@RollTable[TXANbxOC05Qkhdg3]<b>Table:</b> Defining Works</p><h1>Instrument</h1><p>In a bard's quest for the ultimate performance and the highest acclaim, one's instrument is at least as important as one's vocal ability. The instrument's quality of manufacture is a critical factor, of course; the best ones make the best music, and some bards are continually on the lookout for an improvement. Perhaps just as important, though, is the instrument's own entertainment value; those that are bizarrely constructed or made of exotic materials are likely to leave a lasting impression on an audience.</p><p>You might have an \"off the rack\" instrument, perhaps because it's all you can afford right now. Or, if your first instrument was gifted to you, it might be of a more elaborate sort. Are you satisfied with the instrument you have, or do you aspire to replace it with something truly distinctive?</p><p>@RollTable[HRk7lPBl3wj4yp7M]<b>Table:</b> Instruments</p><h1>Embarrassment</h1><p>Almost every bard has suffered at least one bad experience in front of an audience, and chances are you're no exception. No one becomes famous right away, after all; perhaps you had a few small difficulties early in your career, or maybe it took you a while to restore your reputation after one agonizing night when the fates conspired to bring about your theatrical ruin.</p><p>The ways that a performance can go wrong are as varied as the fish in the sea. No matter what sort of disaster might occur, however, a bard has the courage and the confidence to rebound from it-either pressing on with the show (if possible) or promising to come back tomorrow with a new performance that's guaranteed to please.</p><p>@RollTable[TuBivOxQ3B86ms5j]<b>Table:</b> Embarrassments</p><h1>A Bard's Muse</h1><p>Naturally, every bard has a repertoire of songs and stories. Some bards are generalists who can draw from a wide range of topics for each performance, and who take pride in their versatility. Others adopt a more personal approach to their art, driven by their attachment to a muse-a particular concept that inspires much of what those bards do in front of an audience.</p><p>A bard who follows a muse generally does so to gain a deeper understanding of what that muse represents and how to best convey that understanding to others through performance.</p><p>If your bard character has a muse, it could be one of the three described here, or one of your own devising.</p><p><b><i>Nature.</i></b> You feel a kinship with the natural world, and its beauty and mystery inspire you. For you, a tree is deeply symbolic, its roots delving into the dark unknown to draw forth the power of the earth, while its branches reach toward the sun to nourish their flowers and fruit. Nature is the ancient witness who has seen every kingdom rise and fall, even those whose names have been forgotten and wait to be rediscovered. The gods of nature share their secrets with druids and sages, opening their hearts and minds to new ways of seeing, and as with those individuals, you find that your creativity blossoms while you wander in an open field of waving grass or walk in silent reverence through a grove of ancient oaks.</p><p><b><i>Love.</i></b> You are on a quest to identify the essence of true love. Though you do not disdain the superficial love of flesh and form, the deeper form of love that can inspire thousands or bring joy to one's every moment is what you are interested in. Love of this sort takes on many forms, and you can see its presence everywhere-from the sparkling of a beautiful gem to the song of a simple fisher thanking the sea for its bounty. You are on the trail of love, that most precious and mysterious of emotions, and your search fills your stories and your songs with vitality and passion.</p><p><b><i>Conflict.</i></b> Drama embodies conflict, and the best stories have conflict as a key element. From the morning-after tale of a tavern brawl to the saga of an epic battle, from a lover's spat to a rift between powerful dynasties, conflict is what inspires tale-tellers like you to create your best work. Conflict can bring out the best in some people, causing their heroic nature to shine forth and transform the world, but it can cause others to gravitate toward darkness and fall under the sway of evil. You strive to experience or witness all forms of conflict, great and small, so as to study this eternal aspect of life and immortalize it in your words and music.</p><h1>The Bard</h1><table><tr

Bards are preservers of ancient history, their songs and tales perpetuating the memory of great events down through time-knowledge so important that it is memorized and passed along as oral history, to survive even when no written record remains.</p><p>It is also the bard's role to chronicle smaller and more contemporary events-the stories of today's heroes, including their feats of valor as well as their less than impressive failures.</p><p>Of course, the world has many people who can carry a tune or tell a good story, and there's much more to any adventuring bard than a glib tongue and a melodious voice. Yet what truly sets bards apart from others-and from one another-are the style and substance of their performances.</p><p>To grab and hold the attention of an audience, bards are typically flamboyant and outgoing when they perform. The most famous of them are essentially the D&amp;D world's equivalent of pop stars. If you're playing a bard, consider using one of your favorite musicians as a role model for your character.</p><p>You can add some unique aspects to your bard character by considering the suggestions that follow.</p><h1>Defining Work</h1><p>Every successful bard is renowned for at least one piece of performance art, typically a song or a poem that is popular with everyone who hears it. These performances are spoken about for years by those who view them, and some spectators have had their lives forever changed because of the experience.</p><p>If your character is just starting out, your ultimate defining work is likely in the future. But in order to make any sort of living at your profession, chances are you already have a piece or two in your repertoire that have proven to be audience pleasers.</p><p>@RollTable[TXANbxOC05Qkhdg3]<b>Table:</b> Defining Works</p><h1>Instrument</h1><p>In a bard's quest for the ultimate performance and the highest acclaim, one's instrument is at least as important as one's vocal ability. The instrument's quality of manufacture is a critical factor, of course; the best ones make the best music, and some bards are continually on the lookout for an improvement. Perhaps just as important, though, is the instrument's own entertainment value; those that are bizarrely constructed or made of exotic materials are likely to leave a lasting impression on an audience.</p><p>You might have an \"off the rack\" instrument, perhaps because it's all you can afford right now. Or, if your first instrument was gifted to you, it might be of a more elaborate sort. Are you satisfied with the instrument you have, or do you aspire to replace it with something truly distinctive?</p><p>@RollTable[HRk7lPBl3wj4yp7M]<b>Table:</b> Instruments</p><h1>Embarrassment</h1><p>Almost every bard has suffered at least one bad experience in front of an audience, and chances are you're no exception. No one becomes famous right away, after all; perhaps you had a few small difficulties early in your career, or maybe it took you a while to restore your reputation after one agonizing night when the fates conspired to bring about your theatrical ruin.</p><p>The ways that a performance can go wrong are as varied as the fish in the sea. No matter what sort of disaster might occur, however, a bard has the courage and the confidence to rebound from it-either pressing on with the show (if possible) or promising to come back tomorrow with a new performance that's guaranteed to please.</p><p>@RollTable[TuBivOxQ3B86ms5j]<b>Table:</b> Embarrassments</p><h1>A Bard's Muse</h1><p>Naturally, every bard has a repertoire of songs and stories. Some bards are generalists who can draw from a wide range of topics for each performance, and who take pride in their versatility. Others adopt a more personal approach to their art, driven by their attachment to a muse-a particular concept that inspires much of what those bards do in front of an audience.</p><p>A bard who follows a muse generally does so to gain a deeper understanding of what that muse represents and how to best convey that understanding to others through performance.</p><p>If your bard character has a muse, it could be one of the three described here, or one of your own devising.</p><p><b><i>Nature.</i></b> You feel a kinship with the natural world, and its beauty and mystery inspire you. For you, a tree is deeply symbolic, its roots delving into the dark unknown to draw forth the power of the earth, while its branches reach toward the sun to nourish their flowers and fruit. Nature is the ancient witness who has seen every kingdom rise and fall, even those whose names have been forgotten and wait to be rediscovered. The gods of nature share their secrets with druids and sages, opening their hearts and minds to new ways of seeing, and as with those individuals, you find that your creativity blossoms while you wander in an open field of waving grass or walk in silent reverence through a grove of ancient oaks.</p><p><b><i>Love.</i></b> You are on a quest to identify the essence of true love. Though you do not disdain the superficial love of flesh and form, the deeper form of love that can inspire thousands or bring joy to one's every moment is what you are interested in. Love of this sort takes on many forms, and you can see its presence everywhere-from the sparkling of a beautiful gem to the song of a simple fisher thanking the sea for its bounty. You are on the trail of love, that most precious and mysterious of emotions, and your search fills your stories and your songs with vitality and passion.</p><p><b><i>Conflict.</i></b> Drama embodies conflict, and the best stories have conflict as a key element. From the morning-after tale of a tavern brawl to the saga of an epic battle, from a lover's spat to a rift between powerful dynasties, conflict is what inspires tale-tellers like you to create your best work. Conflict can bring out the best in some people, causing their heroic nature to shine forth and transform the world, but it can cause others to gravitate toward darkness and fall under the sway of evil. You strive to experience or witness all forms of conflict, great and small, so as to study this eternal aspect of life and immortalize it in your words and music.</p><h1>The Bard</h1><table><tr

These knights are often most fiercely resisted by other paladins of this oath, who believe that the hell knights have wandered too far into darkness.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<linklist>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>@JournalEntry[0RtMANsT29662CCj]<b>Image: </b>Paladin of Conquest\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></linklist>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h1>Features</h1>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<linklist>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<link class=\"reference_classfeature\" recordname=\"reference.classdata.paladin.features.tenetsofconquest3\" xpath_to_link=\"/reference/classdata/paladin/features/tenetsofconquest3\">Tenets of Conquest\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<link class=\"reference_classfeature\" recordname=\"reference.classdata.paladin.features.conquestoathspells3\" xpath_to_link=\"/reference/classdata/paladin/features/conquestoathspells3\">Conquest Oath Spells\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<link class=\"reference_classfeature\" recordname=\"reference.classdata.paladin.features.channeldivinity_conquest_3\" xpath_to_link=\"/reference/classdata/paladin/features/channeldivinity_conquest_3\">Channel Divinity (Conquest)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<link class=\"reference_classfeature\" recordname=\"reference.classdata.paladin.features.auraofconquest7\" xpath_to_link=\"/reference/classdata/paladin/features/auraofconquest7\">Aura of Conquest\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<link class=\"reference_classfeature\" recordname=\"reference.classdata.paladin.features.scornfulrebuke15\" xpath_to_link=\"/reference/classdata/paladin/features/scornfulrebuke15\">Scornful Rebuke\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<link class=\"reference_classfeature\" recordname=\"reference.classdata.paladin.features.invincibleconqueror20\" xpath_to_link=\"/reference/classdata/paladin/features/invincibleconqueror20\">Invincible Conqueror\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</linklist>\n\t\t\t\t\t</text>\n\t\t\t\t","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","activation":{"type":"","cost":0,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":null},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":"","actionType":"","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":null,"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"requirements":"Paladin","recharge":{"value":null,"charged":false}},"flags":{},"effects":[]},{"_id":"wTBw3sdeXyfup4Ww","name":"Divine Health","type":"feat","data":{"description":{"value":"<text type=\"formattedtext\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>By 3rd level, the divine magic flowing through you makes you immune to disease.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t</text>\n\t\t\t\t","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","activation":{"type":"","cost":0,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":null},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":"","actionType":"","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":null,"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"requirements":"Paladin","recharge":{"value":null,"charged":false}},"flags":{},"effects":[]},{"_id":"4e5sHAOkYrbaNbXx","name":"Sacred Oath","type":"feat","data":{"description":{"value":"<text type=\"formattedtext\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>When you reach 3rd level, you swear the oath that binds you as a paladin forever.

You gain access to these spells at the levels specified in the oath description. Once you gain access to an oath spell, you always have it prepared. Oath spells don't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>If you gain an oath spell that doesn't appear on the paladin spell list, the spell is nonetheless a paladin spell for you.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><b>Breaking Your Oath</b></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>A paladin tries to hold to the highest standards of conduct, but even the most virtuous paladin is fallible. Sometimes the right path proves too demanding, sometimes a situation calls for the lesser of two evils, and sometimes the heat of emotion causes a paladin to transgress his or her oath.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>A paladin who has broken a vow typically seeks absolution from a cleric who shares his or her faith or from another paladin of the same order. The paladin might spend an all night vigil in prayer as a sign of penitence, or undertake a fast or similar act of self-denial. After a rite of confession and forgiveness, the paladin starts fresh.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>If a paladin wilfully violates his or her oath and shows no sign of repentance, the consequences can be more serious. At the DM's discretion, an impenitent paladin might be forced to abandon this class and adopt another, or perhaps to take the Oathbreaker paladin option that appears in the Dungeon Master's Guide.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><b>Channel Divinity</b></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Your oath allows you to channel divine energy to fuel magical effects.

But now an imbalance grows, a force that seeks to hold sway over nature. This is the destructive behavior of the mortal races. The farther away from nature their actions take them, the more corrupting their influence becomes. As druids, we seek mainly to protect and educate, to preserve the Great Balance, but there are times when we must rise up against danger and eradicate it.\n</i><b>-Safhran, archdruid</b></p><p>Druids are the caretakers of the natural world, and it is said that in time a druid becomes the voice of nature, speaking the truth that is too subtle for the general populace to hear. Many who become druids find that they naturally gravitate toward nature; its forces, cycles, and movements fill their minds and spirits with wonder and insight. Many sages and wise folk have studied nature, writing volumes about its mystery and power, but druids are a special kind of being: at some point, they begin to embody these natural forces, producing magical phenomena that link them to the spirit of nature and the flow of life. Because of their strange and mysterious power, druids are often revered, shunned, or considered dangerous by the people around them.</p><p>Your druid character might be a true worshiper of nature, one who has always scorned civilization and found solace in the wild. Or your character could be a child of the city who now strives to bring the civilized world into harmony with the wilderness. You can use the sections that follow to flesh out your druid, regardless of how your character came to the profession.</p><h1>Treasured Item</h1><p>Some druids carry one or more items that are sacred to them or have deep personal significance. Such items are not necessarily magical, but every one is an object whose meaning connects the druid's mind and heart to a profound concept or spiritual outlook.</p><p>When you decide what your character's treasured item is, think about giving it an origin story: how did you come by the item, and why is it important to you?</p><p>@RollTable[WXdebirdYzEtQL8g]<b>Table:</b> Treasured Items</p><h1>Guiding Aspect</h1><p>Many druids feel a strong link to a specific aspect of the natural world, such as a body of water, an animal, a type of tree, or some other sort of plant. You identify with your chosen aspect; by its behavior or its very nature, it sets an example that you seek to emulate.</p><p>@RollTable[DUoMrWpfttqNmbZS]<b>Table:</b> Guiding Aspects</p><h1>Mentor</h1><p>It's not unusual for would-be druids to seek out (or be sought out by) instructors or elders who teach them the basics of their magical arts. Most druids who learn from a mentor begin their training at a young age, and the mentor has a vital role in shaping a student's attitudes and beliefs.</p><p>If your character received training from someone else, who or what was that individual, and what was the nature of your relationship? Did your mentor imbue you with a particular outlook or otherwise influence your approach to achieving the goals of your chosen path?</p><p>@RollTable[zZqkTUq1CQ5cf6sG]<b>Table:</b> Mentors</p><h1>The

When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. If you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, however, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. For example, if you take 10 damage in animal form and have only 1 hit point left, you revert to your normal form and take 9 damage.</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>You can't cast spells, speak, or take any action that requires hands. Transforming doesn't break your concentration on a spell you've already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell you've already cast, such as call lightning.</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>You retain the benefit of any feature from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so.

Worn equipment functions as normal, but the DM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature's shape or size. Your equipment doesn't change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can't wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it.

But now an imbalance grows, a force that seeks to hold sway over nature. This is the destructive behavior of the mortal races. The farther away from nature their actions take them, the more corrupting their influence becomes. As druids, we seek mainly to protect and educate, to preserve the Great Balance, but there are times when we must rise up against danger and eradicate it.\n</i><b>-Safhran, archdruid</b></p><p>Druids are the caretakers of the natural world, and it is said that in time a druid becomes the voice of nature, speaking the truth that is too subtle for the general populace to hear. Many who become druids find that they naturally gravitate toward nature; its forces, cycles, and movements fill their minds and spirits with wonder and insight. Many sages and wise folk have studied nature, writing volumes about its mystery and power, but druids are a special kind of being: at some point, they begin to embody these natural forces, producing magical phenomena that link them to the spirit of nature and the flow of life. Because of their strange and mysterious power, druids are often revered, shunned, or considered dangerous by the people around them.</p><p>Your druid character might be a true worshiper of nature, one who has always scorned civilization and found solace in the wild. Or your character could be a child of the city who now strives to bring the civilized world into harmony with the wilderness. You can use the sections that follow to flesh out your druid, regardless of how your character came to the profession.</p><h1>Treasured Item</h1><p>Some druids carry one or more items that are sacred to them or have deep personal significance. Such items are not necessarily magical, but every one is an object whose meaning connects the druid's mind and heart to a profound concept or spiritual outlook.</p><p>When you decide what your character's treasured item is, think about giving it an origin story: how did you come by the item, and why is it important to you?</p><p>@RollTable[WXdebirdYzEtQL8g]<b>Table:</b> Treasured Items</p><h1>Guiding Aspect</h1><p>Many druids feel a strong link to a specific aspect of the natural world, such as a body of water, an animal, a type of tree, or some other sort of plant. You identify with your chosen aspect; by its behavior or its very nature, it sets an example that you seek to emulate.</p><p>@RollTable[DUoMrWpfttqNmbZS]<b>Table:</b> Guiding Aspects</p><h1>Mentor</h1><p>It's not unusual for would-be druids to seek out (or be sought out by) instructors or elders who teach them the basics of their magical arts. Most druids who learn from a mentor begin their training at a young age, and the mentor has a vital role in shaping a student's attitudes and beliefs.</p><p>If your character received training from someone else, who or what was that individual, and what was the nature of your relationship? Did your mentor imbue you with a particular outlook or otherwise influence your approach to achieving the goals of your chosen path?</p><p>@RollTable[zZqkTUq1CQ5cf6sG]<b>Table:</b> Mentors</p><h1>The

If you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, however, any excess damage carries over to your normal form.

Transforming doesn't break your concentration on a spell you've already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell you've already cast, such as call lightning.</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>You retain the benefit of any feature from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so.

Worn equipment functions as normal, but the DM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature's shape or size. Your equipment doesn't change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can't wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect until you leave the form.</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</list>\n\t\t\t\t\t</text>\n\t\t\t\t","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","activation":{"type":"","cost":0,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":null},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":"","actionType":"","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":null,"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"requirements":"Druid","recharge":{"value":null,"charged":false}},"flags":{},"effects":[]},{"_id":"LK5nagd9r8TIzc6D","name":"Druid Circle","type":"feat","data":{"description":{"value":"<text type=\"formattedtext\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>At 2nd level, you choose to identify with a circle of druids: the Circle of the Land or the Circle of the Moon, both detailed at the end of the class description.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Your choice grants you features at 2nd level, and then again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t</text>\n\t\t\t\t","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","activation":{"type":"","cost":0,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":null},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":"","actionType":"","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":null,"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"requirements":"Druid","recharge":{"value":null,"charged":false}},"flags":{},"effects":[]},{"_id":"AVfQULxwIdQGTVIn","name":"Spirit Totem","type":"feat","data":{"description":{"value":"<text type=\"formattedtext\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Starting at 2nd level, you can call forth nature spirits to influence the world around you.
